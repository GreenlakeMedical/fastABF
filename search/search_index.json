It helps to streamline the computation of ABF activities as per the National Efficient Price ( NEP ) 20-21 framework guidelines. It covers the following major ABF activity types admitted acute admitted sub/non-acute non-admitted emergency department or emergency service Features Fast to setup - go from start to computing an example ABF episode within 5 minutes. Save close to a month of development and testing time! Robust - with python type hints, strong version control (via Poetry) and strong test coverage, the code base has been prepared with production readiness for backend systems in mind. Easy to understand and extend - numerous comments and well structured code organisation, ensure that health IT developers can easily use and extend these modules. Pain free - The code aims to distill the numerous computations detailed in the IHPA NEP 20-21 computation documentation and guidelines into ready to use packages. As those technical documents spans over 60 pages (in addition to the HAC computation guidelines which themselves span over 40 pages ), the creation of fastABF has required a considerable amount of effort. This effort is time that you can now save for making other innovative contributions (or taking several long walks :) ). Lower bug count - By leveraging a well tested and open source code base - developers can reduce the chance of introducing bugs into their ABF calculations by over 25-30% 1 Incorporates METeOR conventions - The METeOR identifiers have been mapped to user friendly Python Enum names. Now instead of remembering the METeOR numerical identifiers you can use these human readable class names - reducing the possibility of bugs and errors creeping in. HAC adjustment computations - The detailed steps of the HAC adjustments (derived from the detailed HAC guidelines) are included as well. In addition the HAC are modeled using an easily reusable Enum class. Remoteness calculations - This code also contains the steps to obtain the remoteness values (from postcode and SA2 address). Hence it enables automatic extraction of the RA16 remoteness class) Helper functions - We have constructed helper functions to simplify workflow (e.g. a Charlson score calculator, remoteness calculators etc) aimed at simplifying future development. Note It is assumed that you are familiar with python at atleast a basic level. the terminology and concepts of ABF . You can follow along in the quick start example via a code editor, python commandline or a jupyter notebook Version fastABF requires python 3.7 or higher. Quick-start Lets see how you can get started using fastABF in under 5 minutes! > pip install fastabf That installs fastabf. Now we get on with using it. Open up a python shell or notebook and type in the following (or copy-paste it from the box below) import fastabf from fastabf.datatypes import ( ABF_Service_Category , Care_Type , Remoteness_Category_RA16 ) from fastabf.pipelines.nwau_admitted_acute import Admitted_Acute_Record aar = fastabf .

In just 5 minutes you have computed the ABF price for an admitted acute episode that included various hospital acquired complication flags, location adjustments etc. This required over 20 steps behind the scenes. The power of using this toolbox is that all of them were orchestrated for you. Important Please note that there are a few values that are unique to each hospital and must be set accordingly. They affect the price computations but would not need to be changed very often. Refer to the global variables section to learn more.

Typical workflow Normally users would like to calculate the ABF prices for episodes. In fastABF this is easily done by gathering various pieces of data required to invoke the corresponding pipeline for each of the ABF cases.

These convenience interfaces help avoid having to remember the METeOR parameter values thereby reducing errors and speeding up code development. These user friendly classes and routines can be found at the following locations in the library. Structure of the fastABF library A simplified overview for users of this library is as follows . \u251c\u2500\u2500 datatypes.py (user friendly interfaces to data types used - more info below) \u251c\u2500\u2500 Helpers \u2514\u2500\u2500 charlson_class.py (computes the charlson complexity, if it is not known) \u2514\u2500\u2500 helper_remoteness_mappings.py (computes remoteness categories) Data types The datatypes module contains user friendly mappings to several of the METeOR classes. Instead of having to remember formally designated numbers, you can use these convenient interfaces in your own code. For the details of the possible values for each category, please refer to the specific section on data types . class ABF_Service_Category ( Enum ) class Care_Type ( Enum ) class Hosp_State_Category ( Enum ) class Indigenous_Status_Category ( Enum ) class MDC_Type ( Enum ) class Remoteness_Category_RA16 ( Enum ) class Sex_Category ( Enum ) class Stay_Category ( Enum ) Helper functions The Charlson class helps compute the Charlson complexity in case it is not known apriori. Similarly the remoteness mappings help automatically use the right order of priorities to assign a remoteness category to an episode.","title":"Detailed overview"},{"location":"detailedintro/#detailed-overview","text":"This page describes the parameters for the cases that are of primary interest to developers who want to start using fastABF.
