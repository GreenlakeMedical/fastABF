# Global variables

As the fastABF module was created for use by health care providers, there are certain specific variables that do not change from one function call to the other, but which are used
in the ABF computations. These are as indicated below

## Constants fixed for the hospital during setup
The following are constants that can be initialised during setup and take their values from the environment. 

| Constant              | Description                | Environment variable |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `hosp_state_constant` | type `Hosp_State_Category` | `HOSPITAL_STATE_INT` |
| `HOSP_PAED_FLAG`      | type bool                  | `HOSP_PAED_FLAG`     |
| `hosp_level3ICU_flag` | type bool                  | `HOSP_L3_ICU_FLAG`   |
| `global_NEP`          | type float                 | `NEP`                |

!!! Warning
    During initialisation please set the above environmental variables as per your requirements. They 
    affect the price computations but do need to be changed very often.
